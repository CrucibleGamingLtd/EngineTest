**Programming Task: Command-Line Slot Machine Game**

**Problem Statement:**

You are tasked with building a command-line slot machine game in Java.  
The game should simulate a basic slot machine with five reels.  
It should run over a variable number of iterations ("spins") and output the number of wins of each symbol type and their value.

**Requirements:**

1. Create a Java program that runs in the command-line interface.
2. The slot machine should have five reels, each displaying three symbols from a random point on each reel.
3. The command line should accept the number of games to play and the cost of a single spin (e.g. 1000 25).  
4. After spinning the reels, display the result of the spin (the symbols on each reel) and indicate whether the player has won or lost.
5. Implement a simple scoring system where certain combinations of symbols result in a win (e.g., three of the same symbol).
6. Track the player's total credits and update them based on wins and losses.
8. Implement error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative bets, non-numeric inputs).

**Stretch Targets**
1. Use of WILD symbols
2. Use of SCATTER symbols to trigger free spins
3. Use of ArrayList and HashMap classes
4. Use of Java 8 streams
5. Collate all spin results and output totals won and lost, indicating the amount returned to player as a percentage of overall cost.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Code organization and structure.
2. Proper usage of Java concepts and classes.
3. Effective implementation of the slot machine mechanics.
4. Error handling and validation of user input.
5. Clear and informative command-line interface.
6. Ability to handle edge cases and unexpected inputs.

**Submission:**

Provide a link to a public repository (e.g., GitHub) containing the source code of your slot machine game along with a brief README explaining how to compile and run the game from the command-line interface.
