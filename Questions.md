# Example Tasks
You can use any intermediate stages you like in these tasks.  
There is no right or wrong way to get to the result.  

## Declare 
1. An enumerated type
2. A simple class which can return the cube of any number
3. An Interface for the above class

## Transform
1. int[]{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}; into type ArrayList
2. Print the resulting ArrayList as a ";" delimited String
3. int[][]{{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}} into int [][]{{1,4,7},{2,5,8},{3,6,9}}

## Create
1. Pick a List of 3 unique numbers from an ArrayList or int[] of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};
2. Write a loop that will print out 3 numbers in sequence from the above starting at a random point in the list each time 50 times eg:  
   3,4,5   
   7,8,9   
   1,2,3 ...
3. An XML Document programmatically with one Node, having 2 attributes eg:  
    \<MyNode name="Level 4" id="20" />
   1. Add a Node with 1 child eg:  
      \<ParentNode>  
           \<ChildNode value="2" />  
      \</ParentNode>

## Error Check
1. Keyboard input for numbers only
2. Keyboard input for a valid email address
3. Parsing a String to an Integer

## Describe
1. Name the git commands you find the most useful apart from add, commit, push
2. What are the main benefits of using git?
